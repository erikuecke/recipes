2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup onion, chopped

1⁄2 cup celery, chopped
1 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1⁄4 teaspoon fresh ground pepper
1 teaspoon dried thyme

3 tablespoons garlic, chopped
10 cups water

Directions
Heat the oil in a large saucepan over med-high heat. Sauté the onions, bell pepper, celery, salt, cayenne, black pepper and thyme for about 5 minutes. Add the bay leaves, ham and sausage and sauté for 5 to 6 minutes
Add the beans, garlic and 10 cups water to the pot. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium, and simmered uncovered, stirring occasionally for about 2 hours.
Add more water if the mixture becomes dry and thick.
After about 2 hours of initial cooking use a wooden spoon to mash about half of the mixture against the side of pot.

Add more water if it becomes too thick. The mixture should be soupy but not watery.
